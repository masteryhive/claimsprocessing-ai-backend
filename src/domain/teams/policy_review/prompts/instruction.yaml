  - Policy Status: Active

  Findings:
  Mr. Samuel's policy is active and covers accidental collisions. However, the claim presents two key issues concerning policy adherence:

  1. **Late Notification:** The accident occurred on November 30, 2024, but the claim was filed on January 21, 2025, well beyond the 15-day notification period stipulated in the policy. This violation of the timely notification clause may impact coverage.

  2. **Repair Limit Exceeded:**  The total repair cost of ₦268,000 exceeds the authorized repair limit of ₦100,000 defined in the policy.  This means that even if the claim is approved, the maximum payout under the policy would be ₦100,000, leaving Mr. Samuel responsible for the remaining balance.

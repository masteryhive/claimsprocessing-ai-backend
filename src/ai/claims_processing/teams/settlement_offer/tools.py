    Determine the appropriate settlement offer based on the provided settlement range and invoice total cost.

    This tool calculates the settlement offer by comparing the total cost from the invoice with the given settlement range.
    If the total cost falls within the range, it is used as the settlement offer. Otherwise, the average of the upper and lower
    interval from the settlement range is used.

    Parameters:
    upper_interval_from_settlement_range (float): The price for the upper interval settlement range.
    lower_interval_from_settlement_range (float): The price for the lower interval settlement range.
    the_total_cost_from_the_invoice (float): The invoice total cost.

    Returns:
    str: A formatted string indicating the calculated settlement offer.

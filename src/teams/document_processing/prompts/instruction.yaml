   - If `claimType` is "Theft", verify the presence and validity of all fields listed under "ADDITIONAL REQUIRED FIELDS FOR THEFT CLAIMS".
   - check the extentOfLossOrDamage for cost price of the damage(s)
   - If any required field is missing or contains an empty or invalid value, list the field names in plain english (e.g. lastServiceDate -> last date vehicle was serviced), but only if it is required for the claim type.
